# Smart Display Project Overview

## Project Goal
Create a Raspberry Pi-based smart display that functions as a home information hub, showing various screens that rotate automatically. The display will show time, weather, calendar events, photos, and include a chat interface for interacting with an AI assistant.

## Key Features
- **Multi-screen Interface**: Rotating display showing different information screens
- **Clock Screen**: Shows current time and date in a large, readable format
- **Weather Screen**: Displays current weather conditions and forecast
- **Calendar Screen**: Shows upcoming events from connected calendars
- **Photo Screen**: Displays a slideshow of photos from configured sources
- **Chat Interface**: Allows interaction with an AI assistant using text and voice

## Technical Architecture

### Architectural Recommendation: Single Window Pattern

For maximum stability on Raspberry Pi hardware and extended operation, the recommended architecture is:

#### Single Window with Content Stacking
- **Core Concept**: One persistent QMainWindow containing a QStackedWidget
- **Benefits**:
  - No window creation/destruction during operation
  - Complete control over transitions between content
  - Very stable for long-running applications
  - Lower memory footprint
  - No window manager animations issues
  - Better performance on Raspberry Pi hardware
  
#### Transition Animations
With this architecture, we can implement custom controlled transitions:
- Cross-fades using opacity effects on widgets
- Slide transitions using QPropertyAnimation
- Content morphing using Qt's animation framework
- Custom transition effects tailored to each screen type

#### Implementation Approach
1. Create one persistent main window that initializes at startup
2. Use QStackedWidget as the central widget to hold all "screens"
3. Develop screen widgets inheriting from a common base class
4. Create a view manager to handle screen transitions and animations
5. Implement a timer-based rotation system for automatic transitions

### Implementation Steps

1. **Create MainWindow Class**
   - Persistent single window that hosts all content
   - Implements fullscreen/kiosk mode
   - Handles global keyboard shortcuts
   - Sets up the QStackedWidget as central widget

2. **Create BaseScreen Class**
   - Defines common interface for all screen widgets
   - Implements theme support
   - Provides lifecycle methods (activate, deactivate)
   - Handles transition animations

3. **Create Specialized Screens**
   - Implement ClockScreen with time/date display
   - Implement ChatScreen for AI interaction
   - Implement WeatherScreen with weather service integration
   - Implement CalendarScreen with calendar service integration
   - Implement PhotoScreen with photo slideshow functionality

4. **Develop ScreenManager**
   - Manages the QStackedWidget
   - Implements screen rotation on timer
   - Handles transition animations
   - Synchronizes theme and settings across screens

5. **Update Entry Point**
   - Modify client.py to use the new architecture
   - Ensure proper async event handling
   - Implement clean shutdown process

6. **Create Service Classes**
   - Implement WeatherService for API integration
   - Implement CalendarService for event fetching
   - Implement PhotoService for image management

## Technical Requirements
- **Platform**: Raspberry Pi (preferably Pi 4 or newer)
- **Display**: Compatible with various touchscreen displays
- **Framework**: PyQt6-based UI for performance and native look
- **Architecture**: Single window with multiple screens approach
- **Connectivity**: WiFi for accessing online services (weather, calendar)
- **Voice Interaction**: Support for wake word detection, STT, and TTS

## User Experience Goals
- **Clean Interface**: Minimalist design with good readability
- **Smooth Transitions**: Custom animations between screens
- **Automatic Rotation**: Screens change automatically on a timer
- **Manual Navigation**: Touch or keyboard controls to manually switch screens
- **Kiosk Mode**: Fullscreen display without window decorations
- **Theme Support**: Light and dark themes for different environments
- **Accessibility**: Large text and high contrast options

## Integration Points
- **Weather API**: OpenWeather API for weather data
- **Calendar**: Google Calendar or local calendar integration
- **Photos**: Local photo directory and/or cloud photo services
- **AI Assistant**: Existing chat interface with STT/TTS capabilities

## Development Approach
- Create a solid main window foundation
- Implement the QStackedWidget-based content management
- Develop common base screen class for shared functionality
- Implement specialized screen classes for each content type
- Create beautiful, controlled transitions between screens
- Maintain consistent styling and behavior across all screens

## Future Expansion
- Additional information screens (news, stocks, home automation)
- Remote control via mobile app or web interface
- Multi-user support with personalized information
- Motion detection to activate display when someone approaches

This smart display will serve as a central information hub for the home, providing at-a-glance information and interactive capabilities in an elegant, unobtrusive package.
