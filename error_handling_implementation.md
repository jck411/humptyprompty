# Standardize Error Handling Implementation

## Overview
The codebase currently has inconsistent error handling approaches across different components. This implementation plan outlines how to standardize error handling throughout the application.

## Current Issues
- Different error handling patterns in network.py, audio.py, and STT components
- Inconsistent logging levels for similar types of errors
- Lack of standardized recovery mechanisms
- Duplicated try/except blocks with similar logic

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Create a Common Error Handler Module

Create a new file `frontend/error_handler.py` that will contain:
- Standardized exception classes for different error types
- Helper functions for consistent error logging
- Recovery mechanism utilities

### 2. Standardize Network Error Handling

Update `frontend/network.py`:
- Replace direct exception handling with the common error handler
- Standardize HTTP error responses
- Implement consistent timeout handling

### 3. Standardize Audio Error Handling

Update `frontend/audio.py`:
- Implement consistent error handling for audio device issues
- Standardize playback error recovery
- Use common error logging patterns

### 4. Standardize STT Error Handling

Update `frontend/stt/deepgram_stt.py`:
- Replace direct exception handling with common error handler
- Implement consistent connection error recovery
- Standardize state management during errors

### 5. Backend Error Standardization

Update backend API endpoints:
- Implement consistent error responses
- Use standardized HTTP status codes
- Ensure proper error logging

## Benefits
- Improved reliability through consistent error recovery
- Easier debugging with standardized error logs
- Reduced code duplication in error handling logic
- Better user experience with predictable error behavior
